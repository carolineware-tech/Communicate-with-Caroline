            <h2>WHY THIS BLOG EXISTS </h2>

            <p>`This blog is more than just code and

                content — it's a living journal of

                classroom experiments, student voices,

                 and the messy magic of learning.

                  I created it to share what we're building,

                  thinking, and feeling as we grow together in tech and life.

                  You'll find reflections, resources, and maybe even a few surprises along the way.</p>

 

<p>And the best part?

    My students will be creating their own blogs too —

     each one a unique window into their world.

      So stay tuned, explore freely, and let curiosity lead the way</p>
